## Current work

Current lead frontend developer for the Industrial AI team at Foxconn in Wisconsin. Responsible for app creation and management of 3 team members. My other duties include creation of a verbose, yet easy to understand user interface that deals with large amounts of user/product data, E2E testing, code reviews, mentoring and app design.  

## My Journey

I'm a self-taught Frontend Developer who spent the better part of the last decade in Tokyo. Previously the Marketing and Brand Manager for [TokyoMTG](https://tokyomtg.com/), a Magic: The Gathering specialty shop in the heart of Tokyo. It was there while redesigning our company's website and logo that I started to realize how closely my marketing and branding experience meshed with web development, sparking a profound interest in frontend web development and design; the rest is history.
I came back during the pandemic to finally be close to family and take on learning web development fulltime; hyper-motivated come out of this globally brutal last year smarter and stronger. 
My first dev role was as a frontend developer on the Japanese casting app **Colorful Casting**Ôºà„Ç´„É©„Éï„É´„Ç≠„É£„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„É≥„Ç∞Ôºâ where my roll is to work on creating modular components, animations, E2E testing and translations. [Colorful Casting (JP only)](https://about.colorfulcast.com/)
Followed a half a year later was my first in-house dev role with Foxconn Industrial AI team. 

## Current Projects

üì¶  [My Dad's Stuff](https://github.com/LovelyAndy/MyDadsStuff) - My main motivation for becoming a developer. My dad is an avid vintage toy and vinyl record collector. The older he gets and the more his collection grows, the harder it is to get everything properly sorted. The app in it's current state is not nearly comprehensive/granular enough for the task, but I am constantly learning new things and implimenting changes as I get better at development. 
Version 1 released in early July on both iOS and Android and I will be continuing to update and add new features to this app until the end of time.

Available now on the App Store! (Google Play Store still in review üòÖ)
