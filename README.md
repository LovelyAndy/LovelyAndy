### Howdy, I'm Andy 🤙🏻

I'm a self-taught Frontend Developer who spent the better part of the last decade in Tokyo. 
I came back during the pandemic to be close to family and take on web development fulltime; motivated come out of the last year smarter and stronger. 
Currently I am frontend developer on the Japanese casting app Colorful Casting（カラフルキャスティング）where my roll is to work on creating modular components, animations, E2E unit testing and translations. Website (JP only): https://casting.love/

## Current Projects

📦  [My Dad's Stuff](https://github.com/LovelyAndy/MyDadsStuff) - My main motivation for becoming a developer. My dad is an avid vintage toy and vinyl record collector. The older he gets and the more his collection grows, the harder it is to get everything properly sorted. The app in it's current state is not nearly comprehensive/granular enough for the task, but I am constantly learning new things and implimenting changes as I get better at development. 
Version 1 released in early July on both iOS and Android and I will be continuing to update and add new features to this app until the end of time.

🤠  [AndyKarwoski.com](https://andykarwoski.com/) - I am constantly working on and trying out new designs for my personal website//portfolio.
