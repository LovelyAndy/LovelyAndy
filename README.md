## Current work

Recently return stateside and taking some time to remake my first ever application [My Dad's Stuff](https://github.com/LovelyAndy/MyDadsStuff). 

## My Journey

I'm a self-taught Frontend Developer who spent the better part of the last decade in Tokyo. Previously the Marketing and Brand Manager for [TokyoMTG](https://tokyomtg.com/), a Magic: The Gathering specialty shop in the heart of Tokyo. It was there while redesigning our company's website and logo that I started to realize how closely my marketing and branding experience meshed with web development, sparking a profound interest in frontend web development and design; the rest is history.
I came back during the pandemic to finally be close to family and take on learning web development fulltime; hyper-motivated come out of this globally brutal last year smarter and stronger. 
My first dev role was as a frontend developer on the Japanese casting app **Colorful Casting**（カラフルキャスティング） where my roll is to work on creating modular components, animations, E2E testing and translations. [Colorful Casting (JP only)](https://about.colorfulcast.com/)

Followed a half a year later (2021) was my first in-house dev role with **Foxconn Industrial AI** team in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Despite it being my first role, I led a team of three frontend devs working on several proprietary apps (mainly dashboards and live views of production lines) in-house as well as maintaining Foxconn's Industrial AI teams homepage.

From there I took a chance back in Tokyo to work at **ColorfulCasting** again with some more skills under my belt. There I was one of a team of five developers, all of which lived outside of Japan besides myself. On top of your general frontend tasks, I also took on the role of technical project manager out of necessity with fully remote, non-Japanese-speaking, developer team besides myself. With previous experience with Agile/Scrum development, I implemented a Scrum + Kanban system for our team to improve our processes using a combination of Notion and Github Projects.

This August I returned to Milwaukee, WI to be closer to family and build a life here back in the states.

Japanese development practices are quite behind the curve and I've been spending time leveling up with more modern practices and adding in some AI assisted development into my workflow as well (Codex and Claude are my standouts at the moment). Exciting times in the Frontend landscape!

Currently on the search for new exciting opportunities in the frontend space!

## Current Projects

📦  Rewriting my first solo app, [My Dad's Stuff](https://github.com/LovelyAndy/MyDadsStuff) - My main motivation for becoming a developer. My dad is an avid vintage toy and vinyl record collector. The older he gets and the more his collection grows, the harder it is to get everything properly sorted.

I'm now currently rewriting the entire app from the ground up in Vue3 and Typescript with the goal of improving all aspects of the previous version; including more understandable UI and bettering the user experience. 

The original is still available now on the App Store! (Google Play Store is currently down)
